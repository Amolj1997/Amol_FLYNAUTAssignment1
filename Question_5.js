// The code you provided doesn't calculate the average correctly 
// due to missing parentheses. The division operation needs to be performed 
// before adding a to the result. Here's the modified code with the corrected formula:

function average(a, b) {
    return (a + b) / 2;
    }
    console.log(average(2, 1));

    // In the modified code, (a + b) is enclosed in parentheses 
    // to ensure that the addition operation is performed before dividing by 2.
    //  This will give the correct average of the two numbers.

    // When you run the modified code, it will output 1.5, which is the average of 2 and 1.
